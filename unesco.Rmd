## Introduction
A World Heritage site is a landmark or area which is selected by the **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)** as having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity. According to UNESCO: *"What makes the concept of World Heritage exceptional is its universal application. World Heritage sites belong to all the peoples of the world, irrespective of the territory on which they are located."* For more information:
