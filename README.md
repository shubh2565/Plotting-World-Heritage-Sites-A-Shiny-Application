# Plotting-World-Heritage-Sites-A-Shiny-Application

A World Heritage site is a landmark or area which is selected by the **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)** as having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity. For more information:

* [UNESCO World Heritage Page](https://whc.unesco.org/en/about/)
* [Wikipedia's World Heritage site Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_site)

This application is made using **Shiny**, an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. We will plot the location of different World Heritage sites using **leaflet**, a widely used open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: [_datahub_](https://old.datahub.io/dataset/unesco-world-heritage-sites/resource/d4116195-44d8-4bc1-9f91-9b570870dc19).
